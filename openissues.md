# Open Issues / Cleanup Tasks

*   Once the Streamlit version (`streamlit_app.py`) is confirmed working and satisfactory:
    *   Delete `flaskapp.py` (the old Flask application file).
    *   Delete the `templates/` directory and its contents (`index.html`).
    *   Ensure `requirements.txt` only contains dependencies needed for the Streamlit version (streamlit, numpy, pandas, plotly).
